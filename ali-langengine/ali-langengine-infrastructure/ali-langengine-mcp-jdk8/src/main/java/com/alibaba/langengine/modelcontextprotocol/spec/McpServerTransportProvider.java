/**
 * The core building block providing the server-side MCP transport. Implement this
 * interface to bridge between a particular server-side technology and the MCP server
 * transport layer.
 *
 * <p>
 * The lifecycle of the provider dictates that it be created first, upon application
 * startup, and then passed into either the synchronous or asynchronous MCP server
 * creation methods. As a result of the MCP server creation, the provider will be 
 * notified of a {@link McpServerSession.Factory} which will be used to handle a 1:1 
 * communication between a newly connected client and the server. The provider's 
 * responsibility is to create instances of {@link McpServerTransport} that the session 
 * will utilise during the session lifetime.
 *
 * <p>
 * Finally, the {@link McpServerTransport}s can be closed in bulk when {@link #close()} or
 * {@link #closeGracefully()} are called as part of the normal application shutdown event.
 * Individual {@link McpServerTransport}s can also be closed on a per-session basis, where
 * the McpServerSession close methods close the provided transport.
 *
 * JDK 1.8 compatible version.
